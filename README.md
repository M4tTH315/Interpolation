# Interpolation
MATLAB Code for Interpolation of given function over a domain of n + 1 equidistant points. Compares 3 different interpolation methods and plots them together on a graph.
Does interpolation using Vandermode Matrix, MATLABS Built in function, and Langrange Method (with included polyinterp function) to the values of x and y calculated from
written in MATLAB line for equidistant points and MATLAB's built in function for equidistant points.

# Polyinterp
Polynomial Interpolation function written for MATLAB is from https://www.mathworks.com/content/dam/mathworks/mathworks-dot-com/moler/interp.pdf
This part of the code is not my own but is fairly easy to follow
